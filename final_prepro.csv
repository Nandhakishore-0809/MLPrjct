realizedmy definition of a real nigga was skewedmy views misshaped by new mixtapesthat confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was truethat real niggas dont speak when they beef with youthey just pull up on your street let the heat achooand if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your foodi was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking copsducking rules hugging blocks that dont love youi pray you find a nigga with goals and point of viewsmuch broader than the corner if not its gon corner youinto a box where your son dont even know his popsand the cyclical nature of doing time continuesmy worst fear is one day that you come home from schooland see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on newsi got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soonand sadly if youre listening now it must mean its truebut maybe theres a chance that its notand this album remains lockedin a hard drive like valuable jewelsand i can teach you this in personlike im teaching you to tie your own shoesi love you and i hope to god i dont lose youfor your eyes onlyfor your eyes for your eyes onlyfor your eyes for your eyes onlyfor your eyes do you understandfor your eyes onlyone day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feelingwhat hed been dealing with lately he wasnt tellingi tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealingbut i could feel the sense of panic in his voiceand it was chilling he saidjermaine i knew you since we was childreni never asked for nothing when times was hardi never had discussions with you begging you to help mei dealt with the repercussions of my actionsi know you tried to steer me way from that shitbut that shit was in my blood you know my lifei know your momma nigga send my lovein case i never get a chance to speak againi

that said the only thing im proud to say i was a fatherwrite my story down and if i passgo play it for my daughter when she readyand so im leaving you this record for your eyes onlydont you ever scratch or disrespect itthis perspective is a real one another lost ville soni dedicate these words to you and all the other childrenaffected by the mass incarceration in this nationthat sent your pops to prison when he needed educationsometimes i think that segregation wouldve done us betteralthough i know that means that i would neverbe brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilledwhen he found him a white girl to take back to jonesborowith lil zach and cole world barely one years oldnow its 30 years later making sure this storys toldgirl your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was coldnot because he was the firstto get some pussy 12 years oldnot because he used to come throughin the caddy on some voguesnot because he went from bagging upthem grams to serving osnah your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was hardnot because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some barsnot because he screamed fuck the lawalthough that was trueyour daddy was a real nigga

Listen,voices are everywhere and theyre screaming at us use me buy me believe me  weve got voices all over our culture chat rooms commercials billboards and bumper stickers and they all want our immediate attentionand then there is that voice from the past or that voice in your head that says you messed up too many times  you cant do it  you cant do it on your own  youre not smart enough  youre not strong enough  youre not stable enough  youre not thin enough  and then theres the enemy  the father of lies that likes to get in there and say no way youll ever make anything of yourselfi had this amazing conversation with my dad not too long ago  hes a great man  i love him so much  and he told me about the first time that his father said something encouraging to him  my dad had just put a room onto his house  and my grandfather was a master carpenter and he was inspecting my dads work  and he got done and went to my dad and said thats a good job harry  and that was the first time my grandfather said something encouraging to my dad and he was 38 years oldman and without hearing that voice  without hearing that whether its the actually the physical audible voice of your father or mother or the voice from god you dont have any identity  you have no way to function  i think jesus knew that  i think thats why when he went through his ministry touching people and healing people and speaking to people  he never asked them to be anything that they werent  he tried to get them to understand who they were  thats why he said youre my daughter youre my son youre my brother youre my sheep  he wanted us to identify with him and understand that were his creation that were worth somethingyeah and thats something amazing about jesus  he could look down into somebodys spirit and draw out who they really were  i mean he looked at simon and said you know what  youre not simon youre peter  youre a rockand how bout that woman that came up to him when he was going through that crowd and she touched his garment and he turned around and he said daughter  his first word daughter you know jesus got that honestly from his father  three times when jesus was under immense pressure in his ministry god the father actually spoke  i mean spoke audibly it wasnt inward  jesus heard it and the people around jesus heard it  like at his baptism god the father said you are my son i love you and im pleased with you  and then at the transfiguration the father spoke again and the disciples heard it  the father said you are my son  i have chosen you and god just established christs purpose on that mountain  and then before christ died at gethsemane in john 12 jesus prayed should i pray to be delivered from this hour  no  this is why ive come  glorify your name father  and the father spoke and said i have glorified it and i will glorify it again  and i think that promise just drove christ to the cross  i think it did too  you may have never heard that voice  that voice that says youre worth it  youre smart enough  i believe in you  i love you  there may be a gaping hole in your spirit where that voice was supposed to speak into and its just a vacuum  listen jesus doesnt require anything of you  you cant work to get his approval  remember when he was affirmed by his father when god looked down and said this is my son who i love  jesus hadnt done a single miracle  all he asks of you is that you listen,Sad
