Jade,she came as lolita dressed as venus and adorned with stars with her deft allusion and a universe between us she showed me her skill with words and i showed her my scars dont mistake kindness for affection she said dont ever let the attention go to your head no more let death divide what life can join together but just remember there is nothing that can last forever and jade is benediction she is silent prayer and jade is exaltation the colours that i wear and jade is contradiction she is naked but never bare jade is a work a work of fiction nothing more than castles in the air the shorter the leash the harder i will pull my glass is empty when once it was full i wish i could be jesus and turn water into wine cause all my grapes have withered withered on the vine with a smile like mercury elusive and fey theres a beauty in the night that cant be seen by day shes a barbed wire angel insatiable and cruel she destroys my resistance like the most dazzling jewel and jade is apostasy abandoned faith and hope jade is hypocrisy she is kaleidoscope and jade is precious stone impervious and rare and jade will never atone for the flowers in her hair and jade never sleeps alone theres always someone there with jade to rest their head on her thigh to make her moist when she is dry to hold the breath of every sigh to pledge their life and how to die to kiss the sleep from her eyes to dry the tears when she cries and jade is all and jade is none and jade is moon and she is sun and jade is you and everyone and she is me and and all ive done and jade is lost and she is won and jade is the bullet shot from your gun ,Relaxed

other side may come soon and if im doomed may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and im not sure why im infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wonderin when ima rest and youre right your brother was a brother to me and your sisters situation was the

4 Your Eyez Only,yeah for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes for your eyes only hey niggas be dying on the daily it seems my dreams faded for far too long the consequences deadly cant visualize myself as nothing but a criminal control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal cause young niggas is hardheaded they letting off full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause aint no coming back family dressed in black plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me like i aint the one who put them jays on her feet like i aint out in the field like that i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless screaming fuck the law my life is lawless thats what you call it aint got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven this is hell and i dont mean that hyperbolic i try to find employment even if its wiping toilets but these felonies be making life the hardest resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it thats why i write this sonnet if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it for your eyes let her know my life is on it for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only you probably grown now so this songll hit you if you hearing this unfortunately means that im no longer with you in the physical not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive he got me praying that the spiritual is real so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too so i know how part of you feels maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me i hope not im tired of dope spots and fiends that smoke rocks ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot im writing this because me and the devil had a dance now i see death around the corner pologizing in advance dont know if i ever had a chance at a glance im a failure addicted to pushing paraphernalia but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight years my pops shot up drugrelated mama addicted so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging blood was staining the concrete older niggas i loved talked like they was above maintaining a timesheet thats slow money picked up the family business by the age of 13 six years later was handed sentence round the same time is when you came in this world me and your mama thinking what the fuck we naming this girl i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was 19 took me two felonies to see the trap this crookedass system set for me and now i fear its too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me im living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catching up to me and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only its several ways i couldve went out too many to count was it the trigger Happy crackers that the badges give clout was it the young niggas blasting frustrated cause the cash running out niggas dont know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed my views misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was true that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you they just pull up on your street let the heat achoo and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you into a box where your son dont even know his pops and the cyclical nature of doing time continues my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon and Sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true but maybe theres a chance that its not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels and i can teach you this in person like im teaching you to tie your own shoes i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling he said jermaine i knew you since we was children i never asked for nothing when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me i dealt with the repercussions of my actions i know you tried to steer me way from that shit but that shit was in my blood you know my life i know your momma nigga send my love in case i never get a chance to speak again i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib thats the way i wished my family lived but my granny crib was in the jects i had to interject like nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions but i been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow like the time im living on is borrowed with that said the only thing im proud to say i was a father write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready and so im leaving you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch or disrespect it this perspective is a real one another lost ville son i dedicate these words to you and all the other children affected by the mass incarceration in this nation that sent your pops to prison when he needed education sometimes i think that segregation wouldve done us better although i know that means that i would never be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesboro with lil zach and cole world barely one years old now its 30 years later making sure this storys told girl your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was cold not because he was the first to get some pussy 12 years old not because he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving os nah your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was hard not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars not because he screamed fuck the law although that was true your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you for your eyes only,Sad

High Hopes,beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young in a world filled with magnets and miracles our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary the ringing of the division bell had begun along the long road and on down the causeway do they still meet there by the cut there was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps running before time took our dreams away leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground to a life consumed by slow decay the grass was greener the light was brighter with friends surrounded the nights of wonder looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us to a glimpse of how green it was on the other side steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again dragged by the force of some inner tide at a higher altitude with flag unfurled we reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world encumbered forever by desire and ambition theres a hunger still unsatisfied our weary eyes still stray to the horizon though down this road weve been so many times the grass was greener the light was brighter the taste was sweeter the nights of wonder with friends surrounded the dawn mist glowing the water flowing the endless river for ever and ever is that charlie hello charlie great,Sad

each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in when they say all of this is approachin its end but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again backs to the wall im stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah ‘cause im talking a lot of shit but im backing it all up but in my head theres a

concerts im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged grab for some water but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on you every woman you insult batter but the doublestandards you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted ‘cause marshall mathers the rappers persona is half a facade and matthew and stans just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til its gone ‘cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off Sad but it happens to all of them im the hindsight to say “i told you so” foreshadows of all the things that are to follow im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow if you dont stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits when its time to walk away im every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if theres anything you have left to say less it makes an impact then dont bother so fore you rest your case better make sure youre packin a wallop so one last time im back before it fades into black and

Hero In A Dream,a witch read from the palm of his hand that his life would turn into darkness and alone he would face all demons from his past that he tries to forget an elder king warned of the dangers that lie in the valleys of north and his only change was to find his shadow so he had to set forth he is the man who travels in the land of dragons and magic spells he rides in the winds of fire and snow and he rules the forest of elves slash of the golden sword a flash in the burning night curse of the evil lord he is fighting for his life for the last time oh such beauty in time but its just external he cannot see the truth with his eyes so he is bound by a lie the snow starts falling in paradise as he gazes at the stars he will be born again in the sky when the night turns into a dawn on the way to the ancient castle of time he will soon be damned by rage so that his pride could betray him when its time to set him free the tears in his mind had to be pushed aside as he walked through the gates he will never die cause he is truly a hero in a dream,Happy

With Strength I Burn,deep green dark chaos blinded i run down these paths by heart i know them they lead to the soaring cliffs stout they stand above the waters edge lifeless and this is my foundation cold stone formed only by winds and time how invulnerable lifeless ahh i have longed to be at one with this yet the waters call my name for once i wish to see the entity behind the voice the face of this seduction the beauty of my pain am i blessed or am i cursed by thy presence what is my crime what is my deed is this life my redemption shall i repent or proceed i hate my flesh its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt it made me question the essence of the i slaves are those of this world given freedom to lay the chains upon the master the wolf is no longer free release the chains and come for me suddenly his mournful cries were stunned out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships sails torn by many a storm and the bows adorned by the most fierce gargoyles hed ever laid eyes upon yet the crew they bore three times twelve in numbers they stood motionless wrapped in grey worn gowns and from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting bidding him on board without hesitation he accepted and away they sailed upon these seas wherein i drowned so many times i scatter the ashes of destiny still my flame is in hunger with fire in my heart shall i greet the shores ahead though i know not what will burn desire ahh in the distance i hear the waves wash over solid ground and in this moment i am struck blind grant me sight so i can see that which lies ahead of me cursed be my mortal eyes for dying in this realm of death hear my call i return to the soaring cliffs they truly shine of strength even though i nothing learned with strength i burn,Sad

The Last Round,when you tricked them into your condemned dream you didnt know who would have control where it took seconds to shape fortunes your pains it weighed down hell spilling blood to cleanse the memories that you know made you so frail empty eyes look through the barrel sweating fingers on the gun one push off the threshold to target sympathies just a broken statue and the world remains unchanged so close and still no place where anything would end trapped between blooded walls and the fight was there today fists breaking against the concrete none to forgive no strength to run how could it be how would it end when you wake up you wish them to cry fragments of this being fragments of its meaning to burn away suffocating in the grasp of this hate driven to fire your last round escape from the air and drown under the earth dead mirror by the wayside nowhere to turn an empty shell buried to the ground prepare yourself to forfait another saviour just another failure where bleak winds grind the surface fear and regret stain dim recollections an act of rash solutions last one there the broken statue built with hands that are bleeding empty eyes look through the shattered image and their pain it weighs down hell spilling blood to cleanse the memories that you know make you so frail how could it be how would it end when you wake up they are holding your time fragments of this being fragments of its meaning,Sad

Old Friends,old friends old friends sat on their park bench like bookends a newspaper blown through the grass falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends old friends winter companions the old men lost in their overcoats waiting for the sunset the sounds of the city sifting through trees settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends can you imagine us years from today sharing a park bench quietly how terribly strange to be 70 old friends memory brushes the same years silently sharing the same fears,Sad

Evenfall,with the dawn comes the loathing with the morning comes the fall with the qualm come the vermin come to spawn from the sun they crawl with the night dies the calm with revulsion comes the spite with the light come the lightmares waking moloch comes with the fall succumb withdraw your soul from this fallacy this infamy is not for us with the night comes deliverance comes the spark that sets us alight with the dark comes remembrance comes the halo comes the flight and the ground takes a fall torn upon winds of witchery resplendent wings unfold revelling in lucid lechery we invoke what no eye can behold azure her gaping portal i blaze in ecstasy the goddess calls immortal shrugs off all treachery stay down wait for evenfall for the night to embrace us again wait for evenfall sleep now wait for evenfall for the abyss will set us free wait for evenfall,Sad

The Special Two (Australian Version),ive hardly been outside my room in days cos i dont feel that i deserve the sunshines rays the darkness helped until the whiskey wore away and it was then i realized that conscience never fades when youre young you have this image of your life that youll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife and you make boundaries youd never dream to cross and if you happen to you wake completely lost but i will fight for you be sure that i will fight until were the special two once again and we will only need each other well bleed together our hands will not be taught to hold anothers cos were the special two and we could only see each other well breathe together these arms will not be taught to need anothers cos were the special two i remember someone old once said to me that lies will lock you up with truth the only key but i was comfortable and warm inside my shell and couldnt see this place could soon become my hell so is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face well i guess the answer is dont do it in the first place i know im not deserving of your trust from you right now but if by chance you change your mind you know i will not let you down cos we were the special two and will be again and we will only need each other well bleed together our hands would not be taught to hold anothers cos were the special two and we could only see each other well breathe together these arms will not be taught to need anothers cos were the special two i step outside my minds eyes for a minute and i look over me like a doctor looking for disease or something that could ease the pain but nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself just remembering just remembering how we were and we would only need each other wed bleed together these hands would not be taught to hold anothers we were the special two and we could only see each other wed bleed together these arms would not be taught to need anothers cos were the special two,Sad

Listen,voices are everywhere and theyre screaming at us use me buy me believe me weve got voices all over our culture chat rooms commercials billboards and bumper stickers and they all want our immediate attention and then there is that voice from the past or that voice in your head that says you messed up too many times you cant do it you cant do it on your own youre not smart enough youre not strong enough youre not stable enough youre not thin enough and then theres the enemy the father of lies that likes to get in there and say no way youll ever make anything of yourself i had this amazing conversation with my dad not too long ago hes a great man i love him so much and he told me about the first time that his father said something encouraging to him my dad had just put a room onto his house and my grandfather was a master carpenter and he was inspecting my dads work and he got done and went to my dad and said thats a good job harry and that was the first time my grandfather said something encouraging to my dad and he was 38 years old man and without hearing that voice without hearing that whether its the actually the physical audible voice of your father or mother or the voice from god you dont have any identity you have no way to function i think jesus knew that i think thats why when he went through his ministry touching people and healing people and speaking to people he never asked them to be anything that they werent he tried to get them to understand who they were thats why he said youre my daughter youre my son youre my brother youre my sheep he wanted us to identify with him and understand that were his creation that were worth something yeah and thats something amazing about jesus he could look down into somebodys spirit and draw out who they really were i mean he looked at simon and said you know what youre not simon youre peter youre a rock and how bout that woman that came up to him when he was going through that crowd and she touched his garment and he turned around and he said daughter his first word daughter you know jesus got that honestly from his father three times when jesus was under immense pressure in his ministry god the father actually spoke i mean spoke audibly it wasnt inward jesus heard it and the people around jesus heard it like at his baptism god the father said you are my son i love you and im pleased with you and then at the transfiguration the father spoke again and the disciples heard it the father said you are my son i have chosen you and god just established christs purpose on that mountain and then before christ died at gethsemane in john 12 jesus prayed should i pray to be delivered from this hour no this is why ive come glorify your name father and the father spoke and said i have glorified it and i will glorify it again and i think that promise just drove christ to the cross i think it did too you may have never heard that voice that voice that says youre worth it youre smart enough i believe in you i love you there may be a gaping hole in your spirit where that voice was supposed to speak into and its just a vacuum listen jesus doesnt require anything of you you cant work to get his approval remember when he was affirmed by his father when god looked down and said this is my son who i love jesus hadnt done a single miracle all he asks of you is that you listen,Sad
